      ' Rendy is the greatest surf instructor I ever had in all my years of surfing ðŸ˜Š He is always with you in the water, pushing you to catch waves, taxiing you to the peak when your shoulders are soar, keeping you safe when a big set is coming. Moreover, Rendy helped make huge progress thanks to his tips: each new wave was an opportunity to feel the effectiveness of Rendyâ€™s advices ðŸ˜Š',
